# Motivation

I grew up in the country side of the Slovenian coast and we had cats since I can remember. Having cats outside was kind of easy. They had plenty of opportunities to find entertainment and they got food whenever they asked for it (or found something to munch on).

While working on my PhD (academic achievements listed here: [here](https://scholar.google.si/citations?user=WhVMGjwAAAAJ&hl=en)) I lived in a rented flat in Ljubljana with my girlfriend. Initially, we didn't have any cats. But soon we filled our lives and had two furry friends - Diablo and Leo (seen in the video on the first page).

That's when I started getting interested in the idea of a cat feeder. Both of us had a full-time job which meant that we were absent from the flat for a large portion of the day. Oftentimes, we also traveled for the weekend (visiting either family). I didn't want to leave a mountain of food in our absence as I didn't want the cats to overeat but at the same time I didn't want them to starve (duh).

# Requirements

Being on a relatively tight budget I didn't want to spend too much money on buying a feeder. Mainly because I felt that they were overpriced for what they offer: "Dispense food when needed". Which led me to the decision to build one myself.

One of the requirements that I set for myself when creating the design was that anyone should be able to build this with simple tools. I decided to use plywood. That is also why, at the time, I had an aversion of using 3D printed parts. It's not because **I** didn't have access to it, but because in 2016 they were so widespread as they are today.

Next, I wanted the feeder to offer a simple web user interface so I can access it from anywhere. Through the interface I need to be able to do the following simple actions: feed immediately and set a schedule.

With these requirements in mind, I started designing [the first version](first_version.md).
