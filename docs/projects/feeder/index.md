# Automated cat feeder

I have cats. I love my cats. Feeding them, however, can sometimes be a bit of a chore or impossible to carry out if I am not at home.

I am an engineer that likes building things. This, combined with the tight budget of a PhD student (the story begins in 2016), led me to make my own cat feeder.

The video was recorded back in 2017 when I completed the second version of the feeder. It was powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero W. It ran a webserver offering a basic UI to trigger the feeding or set a schedule.

It all started with an idea and a design in CAD software ...

... and ended as a device that reliably feeds my feline masters.

In this post I will present the story on how I built my own cat feeder, the reasoning behind some of the technical solutions that I adopted and all the things I learned while working on this project. Strap in and let's go!

!!! warning "Under construction"

    It seems that all my CAD files has been lost between the numerous PC upgrades. For the time being, they are therefore sadly not available. I will make them available as soon as I find them.
