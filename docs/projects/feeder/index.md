# Automated cat feeder

I have cats. I love my cats. Feeding them, however, can sometimes be a bit of a chore. Additionally, I cannot give them the food if I am not there!

That's why I decided to make a cat feeder!

The video was recorded back in 2017 when I completed the second version of the feeder. It was powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero W. It ran a webserver offering a basic UI to trigger the feeding or set a schedule.

It started with an idea and a design in CAD software ...

... and ended as a device that reliably feeds my feline masters.
