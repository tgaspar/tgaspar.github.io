# Overview

This is a collection of my personal projects. One thing that they all have in common is the motivation that made me start each one of them.

In short, the motivation could be stated as: *"Yes, this device does exist already and I can buy it. But the price of the product is ridiculous! I can do it cheaper and better myself"*. Funny enough, I spent just SO MANY HOURS and quite some money on finishing each of the projects that I totally didn't save any money. But at the end of the day, I learned **a ton** working on these projects and I had loads of fun. Isn't this what's important?
