One thing that they all have in common is the motivation that made me start each one of them.</p> <p>In short, the motivation could be stated as: \"Yes, this device does exist already and I can buy it. But the price of the product is ridiculous! I can do it cheaper and better myself\". Funny enough, I spent just SO MANY HOURS and quite some money on finishing each of the projects that I totally didn't save any money. But at the end of the day, I learned a ton working on these projects and I had loads of fun.

Feeding them, however, can sometimes be a bit of a chore or impossible to carry out if I am not at home.</p> <p>I am an engineer that likes building things. This, combined with the tight budget of a PhD student (the story begins in 2016), led me to make my own cat feeder.</p> <p> <p></p> <p>The video was recorded back in 2017 when I completed the second version of the feeder. It was powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero W. It ran a webserver offering a basic UI to trigger the feeding or set a schedule.</p> <p>It all started with an idea and a design in CAD software ...</p> <p></p> <p>... and ended as a device that reliably feeds my feline masters.</p> <p></p> <p>In this post I will present the story on how I built my own cat feeder, the reasoning behind some of the technical solutions that I adopted and all the things I learned while working on this project.

Before the drawing phase I visited the local hardware store to see what kind of plywood do they have available. I decided to use 8mm plywood as it seemed reasonably priced, easy to cut and readily available.</p>"},{"location":"projects/feeder/first_version/#building-the-plywood-construction","title":"Building the plywood construction","text":"<p>As I mentioned, one requirement for the design was that simple tools can be used to build it. I successfully built the plywood construction of the first version by using a drill, a jigsaw, a caliper (that is because I am obsessed with millimeter precision), sandpaper, wood glue and a couple of screws and screwdrivers.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"projects/feeder/first_version/#actuation-and-control","title":"Actuation and control","text":"<p>The actuation of the mill mechanism and the control was implemented mainly with parts I already had laying around. The list goes something like this:</p> <ul> <li>Raspberry Pi B+</li> <li>TPlink USB wireless adapter</li> <li>A simple stepper motor and its controlling PCB</li> <li>A power adapter to go from 230V to 5v</li> </ul> <p>I was thinking of providing the links to all of these components but this is kind of pointless as not only is this feeder design outdated, so are some of the components. The Raspberry Pi for example has seen many upgrades.</p>"},{"location":"projects/feeder/first_version/#transmission-of-mechanical-power-or-how-i-broke-my-anyone-can-build-it-at-home-rule","title":"Transmission of mechanical power or how I broke my \"anyone can build it at home\" rule","text":"<p>Once I made coupled the stepper motor to the axle of the mill I quickly came to the realization that I was ... naive. The required torque to spin the mill once the food was loaded in the feeder was way higher than the poor stepper could handle.</p> <p>I wanted to create something that works first and optimize it later. That is why I then \"took a shortcut\". That meant using some of the resources I had available in the robotics lab where I was doing my PhD.</p> <p>Mainly I needed to add gears between the axle of the mill and the stepper. I took a gear that was not being in use and I 3D printed the other one. Attaching the big gear to the mill axle required an additional component ... some kind of adapter/mounting bracket. I asked a mechanical engineer to give me a quick introduction into how to operate a lathe and I did it out of aluminium.</p> <p>Additionally, also the mill itself needed a 3D printed part. No matter what I tried, using wooden blades simply didn't cut it. So I ended up using some kind of flexible plastic foil for blades and I fixed them to the axle using a 3D printed foil holding piece. Not grate but it did the job.</p>"},{"location":"projects/feeder/first_version/#completed-version","title":"Completed version","text":"<p>The final shape of the first working prototype was ready.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"projects/feeder/first_version/#the-problems","title":"The problems","text":"<p>To be continued ...</p>"},{"location":"projects/feeder/requirements/","title":"Motivation","text":"<p>I grew up in the country side of the Slovenian coast and we had cats since I can remember. Having cats outside was kind of easy. They had plenty of opportunities to find entertainment and they got food whenever they asked for it (or found something to munch on).</p> <p>While working on my PhD (academic achievements listed here: here) I lived in a rented flat in Ljubljana with my girlfriend. Initially, we didn't have any cats. But soon we filled our lives and had two furry friends - Diablo and Leo (seen in the video on the first page).</p> <p>That's when I started getting interested in the idea of a cat feeder. Both of us had a full-time job which meant that we were absent from the flat for a large portion of the day. Oftentimes, we also traveled for the weekend (visiting either family). I didn't want to leave a mountain of food in our absence as I didn't want the cats to overeat but at the same time I didn't want them to starve (duh).</p>"},{"location":"projects/feeder/requirements/#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<p>Being on a relatively tight budget I didn't want to spend too much money on buying a feeder. Mainly because I felt that they were overpriced for what they offer: \"Dispense food when needed\". Which led me to the decision to build one myself.</p> <p>One of the requirements that I set for myself when creating the design was that anyone should be able to build this with simple tools. I decided to use plywood. That is also why, at the time, I had an aversion of using 3D printed parts. It's not because I didn't have access to it, but because in 2016 they were so widespread as they are today.</p> <p>Next, I wanted the feeder to offer a simple web user interface so I can access it from anywhere. Through the interface I need to be able to do the following simple actions: feed immediately and set a schedule.</p> <p>With these requirements in mind, I started designing the first version.</p>"}]}
